A platform that allows users to write stories collaboratively!

### How it works: ### 

* Users post and like writing prompts. Prompts that get 15 likes within 2 days become stories, the rest are deleted.
* Stories are spit into chapters that users submit. Each chapter has a 2 day submission process until the story is done. The most liked submission after 2 days is chosen as that chapter!
